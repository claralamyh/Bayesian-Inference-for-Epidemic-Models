Computer code to reproduce the results for my dissertation, which considers Bayesian inference for epidemic compartment models. 

Two Bayesian posterior simulation methods, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), are applied to understand the underlying system of a real-world epidemic. Both the ordinary differential equation (ODE) and stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are studied.
